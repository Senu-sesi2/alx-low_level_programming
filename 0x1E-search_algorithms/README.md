# The core purpose of this project:

The core purpose of the "0x1E. C - Search Algorithms" project seek to teaching and implementing various search algorithms in the C programming language. Some of the foundamental concept include;

* Understanding and implementing basic search algorithms like linear search and binary search.

* Exploring more advanced search algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

* Learning about heuristic search algorithms like A* and uniform cost search.

* Practicing problem-solving skills by applying these algorithms to different scenarios, such as searching in arrays, trees, or graphs.

* Gaining proficiency in C programming through hands-on coding exercises.

* Understanding the efficiency and trade-offs of different search algorithms in terms of time complexity and space complexity.
